# Practicing with DVC Pipelines

Let's see the use of pipelines in DVC in practice.

## Create repository

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Create a private repository to be used in the experiment and clone it on your machine.

    !!! info ""
        If you create a public repository the `dvc` will also work! It's just a recommendation that it be a private repository.

!!! danger "Important!"
    Access the repository folder and work from there!

## Use `dvc`

Let's initialize `dvc` in our repository.

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Make sure you are at the root of the repository and run:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ dvc init
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

## Basic structure

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Create the basic folder structure for the class.

    ```console
    .
    ├── data
    │   └── bank.csv
    ├── models
    ├── results
    └── src
        ├── preproc.py
        └── train.py
    ```

    !!! info ""
        The `csv` is the same one used in the first class and can also be found [HERE](https://github.com/Insper/mlops/tree/main/content/classes/16-data-versioning/data)!

        We will discuss the remaining files next!

## `preproc.py`

This file will be responsible for performing small transformations on the data to make it suitable for training. As output, it saves a file in the parquet format in the data folder.

Its content is:

??? "Click to see `src/preproc.py` contents"
    ```python
    import pandas as pd


    def preprocess():
        df = pd.read_csv("data/bank.csv")

        # Convert the column to category and map the values
        dep_mapping = {"yes": 1, "no": 0}
        df["deposit"] = df["deposit"].astype("category").map(dep_mapping)

        df = df.drop(
            labels=[
                "default",
                "contact",
                "day",
                "month",
                "pdays",
                "previous",
                "loan",
                "poutcome",
            ],
            axis=1,
        )

        return df


    def export_data(df):
        df.to_parquet("data/bank_preproc.parquet")


    def main():
        df = preprocess()
        export_data(df)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Create the `src/preproc.py` file.

    Ensure you understand its content. Call the professor if necessary.



## `train.py`

This file takes the outputs generated by `preproc.py` and uses them to build two models: a one-hot encoder and a classifier using *RandomForestClassifier*.

As output, this file should generate a *csv* file with performance metrics of the model on the test data and an image of the confusion matrix. Both results are saved in the `results` folder.

Additionally, the file also saves the model pickles in the models folder.

Its content is:

    ```

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Create the `src/train.py` file.

    Ensure you understand its content. Call the professor if necessary.

## Checkpoint

Let's check if everything is working? To do this, let's run both files and check the results produced.

!!! exercise "Question!"
    From the root folder, run:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ python src preproc.py
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Check if the `data/bank_preproc.parquet` file was created.

!!! exercise "Question!"
    From the root folder, run:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ python src/train.py
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Check if the:
    
    - `models/model.pickle`
    - `models/ohe.pickle`
    - `results/confusion_matrix.png`
    - `results/model_test_metrics.csv`
    
    files were created.

!!! exercise "Question!"
    Open the file `results/model_test_metrics.csv` in VSCode or any spreadsheet program and check its contents!

!!! warning "Attention!"
    Delete the files generated by the runs:

    - `models/model.pickle`
    - `models/ohe.pickle`
    - `results/confusion_matrix.png`
    - `results/model_test_metrics.csv`


## Create Pipeline

We verified that we are able to call the execution of each step separately. For now we don't have a defined pipeline yet. Let's do this!

We discussed that the *pipeline* will be made up of one or more *stages*.

We will create the preprocessing *stage*. But first, let's discuss this *stage*:

!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    What are the dependencies for `src/preproc.py` to run successfully?

    Ignore Python library dependencies and think about the required inputs (files).

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        It depends on `data/bank.csv` and the existence of the Python file `src/preproc.py` itself.

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    What are the results or outputs generated by `src/preproc.py`?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        The file `data/bank_preproc.parquet` is generated as output.

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    What is the command to execute `src/preproc.py`?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        `python src/preproc.py`

Information on *dependencies*, *outputs* and how to execute the file must be provided at *stage*. Let's finally create the stage of `src/preproc.py`!

!!! exercise "Question!"
    To do this, run in the terminal:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ dvc stage add --name preproc \
                --deps src/preproc.py \
                --deps data/bank.csv \
                --outs data/bank_preproc.parquet \
                python src/preproc.py
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

    !!! info "Important!"
        Notice that we provided a name for the stage, dependencies, outputs, and the command for its execution from the root directory of the repository.

This will create, at the root of the repository, a *YAML* file `dvc.yaml` containing the information that defines the *pipeline*:

```yaml
stages:
  preproc:
    cmd: python src/preproc.py
    deps:
    - data/bank.csv
    - src/preproc.py
    outs:
    - data/bank_preproc.parquet

```

!!! tip "Tip!"
    The *stages* of the pipeline can be programmed with direct edits in this `dvc.yaml` file or using terminal commands such as `dvc stage add`.

Let's run the pipeline and check the results produced.

!!! warning "Attention!"
    Before running, ensure that the files generated by the previous manual execution (before creating the pipeline) have been deleted.

!!! exercise "Question!"
    From the root folder, run:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ dvc repro

    Running stage 'preproc':                                                                                                  
    > python src/preproc.py
    Generating lock file 'dvc.lock'                                                                                           
    Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'

    To track the changes with git, run:

            git add dvc.lock

    To enable auto staging, run:

            dvc config core.autostage true
    Use `dvc push` to send your updates to remote storage.

    ```

    </div>
    </p>


!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    Use `dvc repro` to rerun the pipeline. What happens?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        *DVC* can see that there were no changes to the dependencies and that there is no need to run the entire pipeline again. This will be especially important to avoid running time-consuming tasks unnecessarily.

        <p>
        <div class="termy">

        ```console
        $ dvc repro

        Stage 'preproc' didn't change, skipping                                                                                   
        Data and pipelines are up to date.

        ```

        </div>
        </p>


## Train Stage

!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    What are the dependencies for `src/train.py` to run successfully?

    Ignore Python library dependencies and think about the required inputs (files).

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        It depends on `data/bank_preproc.parquet` and the existence of the Python file `src/train.py` itself.

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    What are the results or outputs generated by `src/train.py`?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        The files:

        - `models/model.pickle`
        - `models/ohe.pickle`
        - `results/confusion_matrix.png`
        - `results/model_test_metrics.csv`

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    What is the command to execute `src/train.py`?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        `python src/train.py`

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    Write the command to create the *train stage*:

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        <p>
        <div class="termy">

        ```console
        $ dvc stage add --name train \
                --deps src/train.py \
                --deps data/bank_preproc.parquet \
                --outs models/model.pickle \
                --outs models/ohe.pickle \
                --outs results/confusion_matrix.png \
                --outs results/model_test_metrics.csv \
                python src/train.py

        ```

        </div>
        </p>

!!! exercise text short "Question!"
    Create the *train stage* and open the `dvc.yaml` file to check its new contents.

!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    Run the pipeline and check generated files.

!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    Rerun the pipeline. What happens?

!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    In the `train` function of the `train.py` file, edit the `RandomForestClassifier` parameters. 
    Change `n_estimators` from `50` to `100`.

    Rerun the pipeline. What happens?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        The *DVC* can see that there were no changes to anything that affects the *stage* of *preproc*. However, the *stage* of `train` was changed due to the change in the `train.py` file and needs to be run again.

        <p>
        <div class="termy">

        ```console
        $ dvc repro

        Stage 'preproc' didn't change, skipping                                                                                   
        Running stage 'train':                                                                                                    
        > python src/train.py
        Updating lock file 'dvc.lock'                                                                                             

        To track the changes with git, run:

                git add dvc.lock

        To enable auto staging, run:

                dvc config core.autostage true
        Use `dvc push` to send your updates to remote storage.

        ```

        </div>
        </p>


!!! exercise text long "Question!"
    Let's now change something in `preproc.py`. In the `preprocess` function, add the `campaign` column to the list of columns to be removed (`df.drop`).

    Rerun the pipeline. What happens?

    !!! answer "Answer!"
        *DVC* can realize that the changes affect the *stage* of *preproc* and that it needs to be run again.
        
        The *stage* of `train` has not changed but depends on the *stage* of *preproc*, then `train` also needs to be executed.


!!! tip "Tip!"
    To view the *DAG* in the terminal, run:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ dvc dag
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

    Try it yourself!

The combination of *DVC* data versioning features with its *pipeline* management capabilities provides data scientists with a powerful tool that provides easy execution of experiments, while being able to reproduce and audit results.

That's all for today!
