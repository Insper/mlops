# Code Documentation

As we have disscussed, documentation for ML projects is vital as it helps to clarify the project, so that data teams makes faster and continuous evolutions to it.


## Comments in Code

Code comments are a form of internal documentation used by programmers to provide additional context and explanation for sections of source code. They are intended to make the related code more understandable by including information directly in the code itself.

!!! info "Info!"
    Commenting is describing your code for **developers**.

Well-written comments can enhance comprehension by describing the purpose, approach, assumptions, or algorithm being implemented.

### Be Meaningful

When making a comment, a good practice is to think about whether the comment is **meaningful** or whether it is duplicating code. For example:

```python
# Preprocess the training data
preprocessed_train_data = preprocess(train_data)

# Split the preprocessed data into features and labels
X_train = preprocessed_train_data[:, :-1]
y_train = preprocessed_train_data[:, -1]
```

In a professional environment code snippets like these will be seen hundreds of times. Any data scientist knows what is happening just by reading the code.

Therefore, unless it is in an educational environment, these comments may be removed!

Still, it is important to think about whether comments could be exchanged for **code improvements**. For example:

```python
# Performs clustering using spectral clustering
labels = sc(data)
```

In this case, the `sc` method could have a more suitable identifier, `spectral_clustering` for example, which would remove the need for the comment:

```python
labels = spectral_clustering(data)
```

!!! tip "Tip!"
    Remember to don't **over-comment** and to not write comments in the **wrong place** (at random places or many lines before/after code being commented).

## Code Documentation

When **commenting** code, the main audience is the maintainers and developers of the ML project source code.

!!! exercise text long "Question"
    Which other professionals could interact with your project and require documentation?

    !!! answer "Answer"
        Some examples:

        - **Data analysts**: could use the models to make predictions and present them on Dashboards.

        - **Consultants**: consultants from external organizations could use their models to develop new solutions.

        - **Backend developers**: could use the model API to make decisions during a purchasing process on a website, for example.

So, it's important to go beyond just commenting code!

## Sphinx

We will use `sphinx` to generate **documentation** for our ML projects.

!!! tip "Tip!"
    Create a new folder and develop the activities for this class in it!

To install `sphinx`, activate your virtual environment and do:

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ pip install sphinx==7.2.6
    ```

</div>
</p>

Then, create a `docs` folder:

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ mkdir docs
    $ cd docs
    ```

</div>
</p>

And *quickstart* the documentation!

!!! tip "Tip!"
    Provide the:

    - **Project name**: MLearning
    - **Author name(s)**: Your name!
    - **Project release []**: 0.0.1

    Leave the rest as the default.

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ sphinx-quickstart
    Welcome to the Sphinx 7.2.6 quickstart utility.

    Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter to
    accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

    Selected root path: .

    You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx output.
    Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root path, or you separate
    "source" and "build" directories within the root path.
    > Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n

    The project name will occur in several places in the built documentation.
    > Project name: MLearning
    > Author name(s): Maciel V.
    > Project release []: 0.0.1

    If the documents are to be written in a language other than English,
    you can select a language here by its language code. Sphinx will then
    translate text that it generates into that language.

    For a list of supported codes, see
    https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-language.
    > Project language [en]: en

    Creating file /path/to/folder/conf.py.
    Creating file /path/to/folder/index.rst.
    Creating file /path/to/folder/Makefile.
    Creating file /path/to/folder/make.bat.

    Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

    You should now populate your master file /path/to/folder/index.rst and create other documentation
    source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
    make builder
    where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. html, latex or linkcheck.

    ```

</div>
</p>

Let's see a first version of the generated documentation. To do this, call `make` to see all rendering options, and then:

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ make html
    ```

</div>
</p>

!!! tip "Tip!"
    If you are on Windows, run the `make.bat` script.

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ ./make.bat html
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

!!! exercise "Question"
    Open the file `_build/html/index.html` to see a first version of the documentation.

### Automatic Documentation Generation in Sphinx: `autodoc`

One of `sphinx` most useful features is **autodoc**, which allows **automatic extraction of documentation from Python** modules, classes and functions.

With **autodoc**, you don't need to copy and paste documentation into your Sphinx files. It can retrieve pydoc-style docstrings directly from your Python code and embed them into your docs.

!!! exercise "Question"
    Create a `src` folder and paste the following content into `src/spectral.py`:

    ```python
    """
    Spectral Clustering Module

    This is a sample module to demonstrate autodoc
    """


    class SpectralClustering:
        """
        SpectralClustering Class

        Does spectral clustering.
        """

        def train(self):
            """Class method to train the model"""
            pass


    def my_func():
        """Module function example"""
        pass
    ```

    The folder structure will be:
    ![](folders_structure.png)

!!! exercise "Question"
    In the `docs/conf.py` file, replace the `extensions = []` line with:

    !!! danger "Attention!"
       The Python lines (imports and sys.path.insert) also need to be added!

    ```python
    import sys
    import os

    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath("../src"))

    extensions = ["sphinx.ext.autodoc"]
    ```

Then, go to the folder `docs` and run the command to create *reStructuredText* for our Python modules.

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ sphinx-apidoc -o ./ ../src/
    ```

</div>
</p>

!!! info "RST"
    *reStructuredText* (RST) files are plain text files that use a lightweight markup language called reStructuredText.
    
    They are used as the source files for creating documentation in various output formats, such as HTML, PDF, and ePub.

Rebuild and check the result:

<p>
<div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ make html
    ```

</div>
</p>

!!! exercise "Question"
    Open the file `_build/html/index.html` to see the new version of the documentation.


!!! exercise "Question"
    Install a new theme with:

    <p>
    <div class="termy">

    ```console
    $ pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
    ```

    </div>
    </p>

    Then, change `html_theme` variable in the `docs/config.py` file from `html_theme = "alabaster"` to `html_theme = "sphinx_rtd_theme"`.

    Rebuild the project and check the result!
