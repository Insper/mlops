# About this Course

We will learn how to **Take Machine Learning Models to Production**!

## Schedules

- **Monday**: 09:45 AM - 11:45 AM
- **Wednesday**: 09:45 AM - 11:45 AM
- Office hours on **Tuesday** 01:15 PM - 02:45 PM (Teams)

## Deliverables

Students will need to submit some assignments:

- `APS`: practical assigments, developed during and after classes.
- `INT`: some classes will focus on technical interviews in machine learning. These classes will require previous preparation by the students, who will interview each other during those classes.
- `PRO`: in the last classes, students will have to apply the knowledge acquired in a project involving the deploy of an ML model.

## Exams

The interview assignments (`INT`) are like exams. Besides that, there will be no exams, neither classes during the intermediate and final assessment week of Insper's calendar.

## Requirements.txt!

In order for you to absorb the most from the course activities, it is mandatory that you have knowledge in:

- Advanced computer programming
- Cloud computing
- Basic statistics
- Git
- Command line tools


The classes require a lot of autonomy. It's a good idea to have already taken the Insper courses of:

- Cloud computing
- Machine Learning

## AI Guidelines

This course allows the use of generative AI tools, as long as they are used to understand concepts and explore activities (e.g., debugging). Students should understand what's happening at each step, and it's important to keep the learning objectives in mind.

## Final grade

The final grade is calculated with the following formula

```
NF = 0.35*APS + 0.30*INT + 0.35*PRO
```

Some conditions are required for approval:

- Grade average greater than or equal to `5.0` in **APS**, **INT** and **PRO**.
- A maximum of two assignments (interviews + APS) with a score of zero or not submitted.

If any of these criteria is not met, the student will fail this course!
