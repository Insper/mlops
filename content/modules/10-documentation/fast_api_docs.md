!!! danger "Do you remember?!"
    This is just a remembering topic!

Automated generation of software documentation is part of state of the art in software engineering discussed methods.

[APIs](../02-api/api_deploy.md) are a traditional deployment choice for ML applications. Therefore, it is necessary to provide documentation of the available routes (API descriptions).

As we have seen in class 02, [**FastAPI generates autodoc from code**](../02-api/api_deploy.md#an-api-that-makes-predictions). The documentation can be accessed in `/docs` route, for example, `http://localhost:8000/docs`.
