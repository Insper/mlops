## Interview subject

We will focus mainly on the subjects studied in the previous classes:

- Introduction to MLOps
- ML life cycle
- Categories of Model Deployment
- APIs
- Online prediction
- Batch prediction

Use the available references and do extra research to delve deeper into the subjects.

In addition, some interview questions will go beyond the skills practiced in MLOps classes, so that you recall and re-evaluate your skills acquired in other courses.

For example, on the Ciência dos Dados final project you used a lot of communication skills. There may be questions that require, for example, explaining a concept to a manager.
